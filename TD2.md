HUB, it is a device that not good why?. it does just broadcasting (diffusion). This broadcast generated by the HUB will produce too much UNNECESSARY IP traffic The HUB will just take the incoming signal and will broadcast all over the network 
==> Congestion of the network 
==> less bandwidth (very very very bad) 
==> more latency 
==> a lot of collisions in the network

6) This is not good the better alternatives is to use a switch The advantage of switch is there is NO BROADCAST... Excellent it resolves all of the issues that we faced with the hub.
 =====> no congestion of the network (no broadcast, all the communications are one to one) 
 =====> Every client in the network has full bandwidth. 
 =====> almost no latency 
 =====>ZERO collisions 

7) the path is really just one-to-one communication, every client is talking directly to the server. it is Unicast communication (no broadcast) 

8) Since there is no collisions, the final data received by the server correspond to the exact information sent by the client. 

9) Manchester encoding Homework: 
read about manchester encoding 
there is an online manchester encoding calculator

Part1: we create our game in a LAN network (Local Area Network). 
it is local (means it is geographically limited to one room or one building) 
Part3: we want to open our game to the outside (it is not local anymore). 
We will open our game to the WAN (wide area network, réseau étendu) will have sites, every site is connected to the internet through a router.the routers will connected to FAI (fournisseur d'accès internet). our different sites will be connected to the internet. where should we put the server?

the best option is to put a server in the cloud. 

### Why the cloud? 

1. guarantee that the server will never go down 
2. high computation power (very strong servers) 
3. load balancing     
**there are many benefits to put the server in the cloud**    
... to connect our two sites, we will use a broadband connection (bande large). 
Analog signal? signal analogique? (Continue in time)
Digital signal? (0101010)
WAN connection uses analog signal
is a signal that it continues in time. the problem is computer do not process analog signal Computer process discrete signal (manchester signal) 
The signal need to be converted from analog signal to manchester signal that is called "modulation" it is the modem who does the "modulation/demodulation"

do you know what is a mac address?

it is physical address, it is located in the NIC (network Interface card, carte réseau). it is unique in the world. 
how many bits do we have in a mac address? we have 48 bits, represented in hexadecimal (in total we have 12 hexadecimal numbers) 








the time that will take 1 bit to cross the medium from end to end is called the propagation time Tp 
it depends on: 
1- type of medium you are using: copper cable, fibre cable, wifi... 
2- length of the medium 
the transmission time is the time that takes to transmit the whole frame Tx the reception time is time that takes to receive all of the frame Rx 
Data emission rate is how many bits are produced per second by your computer (generally 1 bit every 1 microsecond), this depends on how fast is your computer (CPU, network card...)
Emission time is to transmit all of the frame limited by hop 
Data transfer rate 

64 Bytes = 64 x 8 = 512 bits the condition is to have Te >= 2Tp. it is the condition that we must respect to have CSMA/CD works
